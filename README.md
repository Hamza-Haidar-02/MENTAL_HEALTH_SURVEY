# 🧠 Mental Health Consequence Prediction using AutoAI

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that uses IBM Watsonx AutoAI to train machine learning models that predict mental health consequences in the workplace, based on demographic, professional, and psychological survey data.

✅ This notebook leverages the ibm-watsonx-ai package with Python 3.11 to automate model training, comparison, and evaluation — no manual tuning required

## 📋 Dataset Overview

This project is based on a mental health survey dataset containing responses from individuals across various countries and work environments. The target variable for prediction is:

mental_health_consequence
(Will there be negative consequences if the respondent discusses a mental health issue at work?)

## 🎯 Project Goals

The objective of this notebook is to:

✅ Load and explore mental health survey data
✅ Preprocess data for model training
✅ Use IBM Watsonx AutoAI to automatically train models
✅ Compare model performance
✅ Predict mental_health_consequence for new/unseen survey responses

## 🛠️ Requirements

->Python 3.11
->ibm-watsonx-ai package
->IBM Cloud account with Watsonx credentials

## 🔍 Example Use Case

This notebook helps predict if individuals believe discussing mental health at work may lead to negative consequences — a valuable insight for HR teams, wellness program designers, and mental health advocates in the workplace.
